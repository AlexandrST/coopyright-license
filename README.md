    Project Author: David Liberman and Daniil Liberman (https://github.com/libermans)
    Project Wallet: [id3]
    Terms of use: Use requires the inclusion of links to this project, and the addition of the cost for 
    consumers of products using the results of this project, as determined in Pricing.
    Pricing: Any product distributed under this license must add 0.1% to the cost determined by its Author. 
    These funds must go to the licence project’s wallet (Project Wallet) to cover the cost of work creating 
    a license (the cost of commits to the master branch of this project). After the cost of the commits 
    to the master branch is covered, the added percentage will decrease, sharing the cost among all consumers 
    of products distributed under this license. To do this, the funds coming to the Project's Wallet from 
    subsequent consumers will go to refund consumers who have already paid for the use of products 
    distributed under this license. By the moment when the additional interest reaches 0.001% for all 
    consumers, subsequent use of this license, in the version created in the master branch of this project, 
    will become free.

## Project Description

The project will develop a new license, the Coopyright License (or Cōpiaright License), which will primarily apply to the distribution of intellectual property. Coopyright License enables redistribution of development cost among all consumers.

Within the framework of this project, the first version of the legal text of the license under US law will be developed, and derivative branches of license development that take into account the specifics of other jurisdictions will be launched.

**(WIP) The license text will be found here: [link](license.md)**

Just as the emergence of the Creative Commons license has changed the nature of non-commercial distribution of intellectual products, we can create a new principle of their commercial distribution. The described license will allow to adopt the best features of Open Source and Free Market.
 
### Principles of the license (brief):
  1. Redistribution of the cost of product creation between consumers
  2. Open and unrestricted use, modification and distribution of the product
  3. Transparency of information on the number of copies of products consumed 

### Principles of the license (full):
  1. The first principle of this license will be a gradual reduction in the price of a copy, as the number of consumers increases. The price will decrease with each new copy bought, not only for new (subsequent) buyers, but also for those who previously made a purchase. The price reduction for previous buyers will be realized through the return of part of their payment at the expense of funds coming from subsequent buyers. The price reduction will occur automatically according to a predetermined formula. This price reduction will reflect the effect where the cost of creating a copied product can be distributed among an increasing number of consumers of copies of this product, since after the creation of the first copy all subsequent copies have an extremely low production cost. Thus, the cost of the copied product distributed under this license will be redistributed among all users of its copies. And as a result, consumers of the product sold under this license will be actively interested in this product being distributed, since with each new copy sold they will have more and more of the price refunded to them.
 
  2. The second principle of this license will be the free (unlimited) use (inclusion) of this product, or its parts, with any modifications, in other new products, subject to the following two conditions: a) the derived products directly refer to the "source"; b) when each copy of these new products is sold, its price includes the price that should have been paid for a copy of the source code, while retaining the principle of price redistribution with increasing uses of the "source" product.

  3. The third principle of this license will be the mandatory transparency of information on the number of consumed copies and the price of the product (or its components) distributed under this license. This principle allows to ensure the trust of the participants of the process (the creators of the main product, the creators of derivatives, and consumers) in the mechanisms specified in the first principles.

### Advantages of distributing products under the Coopyright License (short):
  1. Competitive advantage in the eyes of consumers
  2. Increase product availability
  3. A new source of capital for product development
  4. Reducing production risks for new copyable products
  5. Speedy distribution of copyable products
  6. Income from derivative products
  7. The speed of innovation

### Advantages of distributing products under the Coopyright License (full):
  1. In case of a product being distributed  under the Coopyright License, consumers will have the potential ability to receive the product much cheaper than if they buy a similar product distributed under standard licenses. The more popular the consumer expects the product to be, the greater correction for the price they will make. In the case of products distributed under today's standard licenses, once an amount has been paid for a copy, it will not be revised in the future. Thus, although establishing the same price as their competitors for a copy of the product, or even sometimes a higher price, an author distributing their product under the Coopyright License will gain a competitive advantage in the eyes of consumers in comparison with goods not distributed under this license.
 
  2. An actual or even merely expected decrease in the price will greatly expand the product’s potential consumer base.

  3. Even before the end of production, the manufacturer can suggest to enthusiasts of their product that they send an advance payment at a fairly high price per copy. Thus they will be involved in financing the creation of the product; even a very small number of enthusiasts can be sufficient to cover the entire amount needed, to the same extent as today capital is attracted to create products on crowdfunding platforms. However, unlike modern crowdfunding models, all those who pay a high initial price will be able to expect that in the event of future product distribution, most of the price they have paid will be returned. 

  4. This model of distribution of goods will allow the most rapid way to cover the cost of creating goods, at a stage when the product is still used only by early adopters. It is possible to cover the risks even before the launch of the production, or at least very quickly after production is completed.

  5. Because your existing consumers will be interested in increasing the number of consumers of the product, they will become ambassadors promoting your product among their acquaintances. At the same time, since they can not earn more than they paid for this product themselves, this will not create a destructive situation for relationships, where their acquaintances may feel that they are being used for a profit.

  6. In addition, due to the unhindered creation of other derivative products based on the original product, the creator of the original product will receive an entire ecosystem of interested producers and their consumers. They will all be financially interested in the distribution of their derivative products, while the price of a copy of the derivative products will include payments that will go to the manufacturer of the original product. These payments from the consumption of the derivative products will also reduce the price of a copy of the original product for all its consumers, and for consumers of other derived products. This effect will further enhance all the above benefits.

  7. The ecosystem created around each product distributed by the Coopyright License will lead to the maximum speed of innovation. A similar effect we see today in the case of computer vision, where all the most advanced algorithms are open source projects. The resulting ecosystem will further strengthen the competitive advantage of such products, in comparison with competitors. In the same ecosystem, you can expect that different manufacturers will sooner compete by adding additional features to the original product and including their price in the total price of the product than by creating from scratch a new product with the addition of the new function at hand. 

In addition to direct advantages for manufacturers distributing their products under this license and for their customers, this license allows us to significantly increase the speed of development of mankind as a whole. The use of such a license will prevent the spread of poverty due to automation. Avoiding future upheavals and revolutions, it will lead us into a world which gets wealthier together.

This license is the result of the continued work of David and Daniel Liberman in 2016 and 2017, as well as the continued participation of Maria and Anna Liberman, as reflected in the cost of the first commit. The license is also based on the results of their work in 2001-2015 in the course of identifying critical infrastructure projects that will allow to create more effective interaction between global communities. However, this 2001-2015 work will be taken into account in the respective individual projects.

The work includes work on the description of **Cōpia**, which can be found here [link]. This will be developed in a separate project.

The cost of all work to create this license will be collected in this file; each pull request to the master branch should contain changes to [cost.md](cost.md) file with the addition of the cost of the work that the author of the changes within this pull request wants to include. In this format:

    Cost: 2 x 500 hours х 1.5 ETH + 2 x 200 hours х 1.5 ETH
    Authors: David Liberman and Daniil Liberman (https://github.com/libermans)
    Wallet: [id2]
    Date: November 18, 2017
    Descriprion: First commit [2016 - 2017]

This project will also be the starting point for individual projects in which tools will be created to effectively implement the principles described here for the development and distribution of products under the Coopyright License.

All the texts of this project will be translated into English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Russian, Japanese and other languages. Links to these translations will be found here:

David Liberman and Daniil Liberman intend to use the license made in the framework of the head branch of this project in their future projects and have made a prepayment towards the future commission for the use of the license in the amount of 300 ETH to Wallet [id3]. These funds can be used immediately to compensate the contributions of Contributors to this project. Compensation of the personal contribution of time is postponed until the completion of the first version of the license and will be carried out together with compensation for the unpaid contributions of other Contributors to the master branch of this project (in proportion to the unpaid contribution for the moment).
